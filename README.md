### Live site at [Password Generator](https://cgsdesign.github.io/passwordGen/.)
​
For this project I worked primarily in Javasript to create a functional password generator. The given generator allows for various input types: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. It also allows for password length between 8 and 128 characters. It relies on clear prompts to gain user input criteria.
​
## Key Features
* Clean CSS matching brand orange
* Multiple variable prompt inputs linked to generate single output
* Lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols available to chose from 
* Wide range of password lengths available: 8-128 characters
* Inclusion of multiple levels of shuffling to better ensure password security
